# This file controls instrumentation of functions using sancov, which is used to support
# trajectory-evaluation by the photesthesis tool.
#
# For a function to be instrumented is must both reside in file listed in a 'src:' pattern
# _and_ have a name listed in a 'fun:' pattern.

# Instrument everything in the main stellar src directories
