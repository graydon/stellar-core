    // Note: at the moment we're using a timer to throttle _down_ the amount of
    // "work" we do statically: we set a yield timer to 1ms so that in case
    // we're a long-running step, we don't hog the CPU and incur IO debt.
    //
    // Long-running work steps are a problem in practice: specifically the
    // bucket-apply work tends to have a long pause when it commits -- longer
    // than the presumed quantum in the central IO-vs-RR-queues time-slicing
    // scheme -- and this can cause a node that is catching up to starve IO and
    // desync.
    //
    // In other words, while we _could_ avoid trying to explicitly time-slice
    // ourselves here, and instead post ourselves to the RR queues, the problem
    // with this is that the RR queues do not currently account for IO debt very
    // well and we may well go "over budget" every time we get scheduled. The RR
    // queues really need to track how much a callback exceeds its yield-timer
    // loop and treat that as over-budget debt to pay off in subsequent
    // iterations, to maintain a static schedule. This is TBD.
